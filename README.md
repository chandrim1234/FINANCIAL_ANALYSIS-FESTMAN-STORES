Conclusion: While overall profits have surged significantly, the decrease in profit margin may indicate rising costs or increased discounting strategies that need further analysis for optimization.

High Discounts: 57.76% of orders received a high discount.

Medium Discounts: 32.62% of orders. Low Discounts: 9.62% of orders.

Conclusion: A significant portion of the orders benefited from high discounts, which could explain the slight dip in the profit margin despite a large sales increase. This raises the question of whether the discounts are sustainable or if adjustments are needed to improve profitability.
